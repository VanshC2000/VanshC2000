# Hi there, it's Vansh üëã

## About me

I'm a recent graduate of the MSc. in Management Analytics Program at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario. I have developed a strong foundation in business analytics and am driven by a passion for leveraging data to derive business insights and tell powerful stories. Equipped with skills in machine learning, data visualization, statistical analysis, and data interpretation, I am excited to embark on a career as a business analyst, where I can apply my skills to help organizations make informed, data-driven decisions.

Before I decided to jump across a pond (or 7) from Mumbai, India, I worked at a leading global ad network as a Senior Digital Campaign Manager. I managed a large number of high-budget digital ad campaigns for four different projects. To optimize these campaigns, I monitored several web analytics dashboards and tweaked campaign settings based on current and predicted trends. While not a traditional marketing analytics position, it broadened my understanding of data analytics and strengthened my number-crunching skills. I also found a sense of achievement in knowing that an improvement in the performance of a digital campaign or project can be directly attributed to the decisions and optimisations made by me. This role influenced my career switch to data analytics. 

When I'm not developing predictive models, cleaning messy data or reading to keep up with this dynamic industry, you'll find me in the kitchen experimenting with whacky food recipes üë®‚Äçüç≥. On the weekends, you'll find me on a hike, pretending I'm a movie protagonist on a quest for spiritual enlightenment üåÑ.
